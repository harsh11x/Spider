# Spider

## Overview
Spider Light Up with Glowing Dots is an interactive JavaScript-based animation. The project features glowing dots that react dynamically to the movement of a spider. As the spider moves across the screen, nearby dots light up, creating a beautiful visual effect. The animation runs smoothly on an HTML5 canvas.

## Features
- Interactive animation where a spider follows mouse movement
- Glowing dots that react to proximity to the spider
- Smooth and lightweight, built entirely with JavaScript and HTML5
- Dynamic light effects with smooth transitions

## How It Works
- The canvas consists of multiple dots, each moving slightly.
- When the spider moves near a dot, it causes the dot to glow.
- The spider moves across the canvas following the user's cursor.
- Dynamic radial lighting effect is rendered around the spider.
